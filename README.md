# default_character_config

Skyrim SE mod that allows configuring various aspects of the character utilized
by new games as well as by the `coc` command (when the command is used from the
main menu without having loaded a save since game launch).

# Features

- Select a race and gender
- Select a doomstone
- Select spells
- Select from a suite of origins which determine starting items

# Planned Features

- Select factions
- Add spells from Dragonborn DLC (Dawnguard already complete)
- More origins

# How to Use

Select options from the fomod installation wizard, then launch the game and
start a new character via using the `coc` command from the main menu.

# Why

This is useful for people like myself who spend more time making mods and
testing than actually playing the game. I just can't stand the default character
having pathetic sprinting abilities due to their heavy armor, and when you have
to toggle god mode to fix it, it starts to add up after a few hundred game
launches. This mod enables me to configure a character in advance, then any time
I `coc` to test something, I load up as that character instead of the default
nord.
